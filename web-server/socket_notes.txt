Sockets are endpoints of bidirectional communications channel.
Can communicate:
- within process
- between processes on same machine
- between processes on different machines
The socket class provides classes for handling common transports

... Vocabulary ...

domain - protocols that are used as the transport mechanism

type - type of communication between two endpoints
    SOCK_STREAM - connection protocols
    SOCK_DGRAM - connectionless protocols

protocol - 0, variant of protocol within domain and type

hostname - identifier of network interface
    host name, dotted-quad address, IPv6
    "<broadcast>" which specifies INADDR_BROADCAST address
    zero-lenth string that specifies INADDR_ANY or
    Integer, binary address in host byte order

port - listen for clients calling on one or more port, can be number,
string, or name of service

Flow:
1. Build Listening Socket
socket().bind().listen().accept()
Listens for connections from clients. When client .connect(), server .accept()
2. Round Trip
.send().recv()
Both client and server send and receive data
3. Close Sockets
close()
